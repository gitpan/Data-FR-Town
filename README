Data-FR-Town

This module provides basic data about french towns.

    use Data::FR::Town;

    # Multiple ways to get the same town
    my $town1 = Data::FR::Town->new( {insee => "01001"});
    my $town2 = Data::FR::Town->new( {zip => "01400"});
    my $town3 = Data::FR::Town->find( {insee => "01001"});
    my $town3 = Data::FR::Town->find( {zip => "01400"});

    Now you can get data about the selected town, using the getters :

    my $zip = $town1->zip();
    my $name = $town1->name();
    my $cname = $town1->cname();
    ...
